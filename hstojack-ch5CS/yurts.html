    <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
    <dl>
       <dt><strong> What is a yurt </strong> </dt>
       <dd> Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>

       <dt><strong> How are the yurts furnished?</strong> </dt>
       <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>

       <dt><strong> What should I bring? </strong> </dt>
       <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
